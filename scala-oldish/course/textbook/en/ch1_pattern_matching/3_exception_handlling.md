Exception handling
==================

`Scala` has a very similar way of the exception production and handling. In
`Scala`, all exceptions are [unchecked][unchecked-ex].

You may read more about the exception handling in Jacob Jenkov's
[blog][jenkov-ex], where the traditional (imperative) approach is illustrated
nicely.

`Scala` also supports functional ways of exception handling, and we will come
back to them at the end of the course.
