OOP 101
=======

This topic is all about object-oriented features of `Scala`. We assume that
you're familiar with OOP concepts, that's why we will recommend you to read
[A Scala Tutorial for Java Programmers][oop-for-java-devs], which is a part
of the official `Scala` documentation.

You could also benefit from the 'trait section' of the official
[documentation][traits].

A short overview of object-oriented part of `Scala` you may find
in [this][oop-overview] presentation.

*Note:*
> on page 22 of the given presentation, there's a type `ScalaObject` in type
> hierarchy diagram, that is subtype of `AnyRef`. This type was considered
> deprecated and doesn't exist any longer. Now all java and scala objects are
> subtypes of `AnyRef`

Yet another one, more detailed overview you may find [here][oop-more-detailed].

## More on objects
[Here][objects-in-scala] you may read more about objects in `Scala`.


## Constructor overloading
`Scala` supports [constructor overloading][ctor-overloading]. But it's not
the best way to handle a problem. It's not an *idiomatic* solution. This
function becomes useful, if your overloaded constructor will be called in
java context. In other cases overloading your class companion's `apply` will
be a good strategy.


## Video
The story of traits: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdBkw9TU_u4
the video illustrates multiple inheritance in `Scala` compared to other
languages like `Java` and `Groovy`.
