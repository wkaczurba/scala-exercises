Conclusion
==========
At the end of this chapter, we would recommend you to look at the
[Effective Scala][effective-scala], and after that to start with practical
part. You may find your first task inside `assignments.md`, which is located
in the current folder.

And please, don't be upset if you weren't able to understand all concepts that
were listed inside this chapter. It's OK. You can always come back to them later.
