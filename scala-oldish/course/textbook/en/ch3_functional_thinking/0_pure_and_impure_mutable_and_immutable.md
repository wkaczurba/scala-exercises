Purity & immutability
=====================

In this topic you will learn more about pure functions and
[side effects][side-effect-wiki].

You may read [The Definition of "Pure Function"][pure-fun-def] to get more
information about that topic. The second part is located [here][pure-fun-def-2].

Here are the main concepts that were illustrated before:

 - [Scala programming best practice: Prefer immutable variables (values)][idiom-1]
 - [Scala best practice: Create methods that have no side effects (pure functions)][idiom-2]
 - [Scala idiom: Prefer immutable code (immutable data structures)][idiom-3]
 - [Scala idiom: Methods should not have side effects][idiom-4]
