QUestions to Paul:

***Imports***

1. **Idea environment** - getting out of sync with sbt. Imports not showing up etc... How to deal with it?
   I can run example using sbt but can't run the code in Idea after adding new import.;
   Do I need to invalidate caches+restart everytime a new dependency is added?

2. REPL - how to get shapless to run in REPL?
