Conclusion
==========
`Scala` -- is very sophisticated language, and it's not possible to comprise all
details of syntax and semantics of the language. Honestly, we didn't aim to do
it. The purpose of this course is to let you think functionally.

`Scala` is an object oriented language. Everything in `Scala` is an object. Even
functions, that is an instance of `FunctionN` class (where `N` is function's
arity). Scala rich its object-oriented features and we expect that you're
already familiar with concepts of `OOP`, that's why those features weren't
covered.


`Scala` is a functional language to. Some functional languages lacks a number
of features that `Scala` gives you. For example, `Scala` supports currying that
is not supported by `Erlang`.

Wish you luck in your future endeavors.


Further reading
===============
`Scala` has it's own [Scala Style Guide][style-guide]. We also recommend you
yo watch an amazing talk given by Martin Odersky (the creator of `Scala`):
[Scala with Style][scala-with-style] and [style guide][databricks-guide] by
`Databricks`. You should also read [Effective Scala][effective-scala]. It's not
that big as `Effective Java` if you're familiar with that. It's a short article
that worth reading for every `Scala` developer.

Books
=====

  - Scala for the Impatient (2nd Edition) by Cay S. Horstmann -- you may find it
  [here][scala-impatient]
  - Programming in Scala by Martin Odersky, Lex Spoon & Bill Venners.
  This book can be called a `Magnum Opus`. It explains all language details in
  a nutshell. You may find it [here][magnum-opus]

There is a great amount of decent books available. But those books didn't
keep up with changes in `2.12`. I would also recommend `Atomic Scala` when
it will be synchronized with the latest version.
